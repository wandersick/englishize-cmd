             http://tech.wandersick.com | wandersick@gmail.com

     [ What? ]

  .  Toggles between English and non-English for most Windows commands.

  .  For English system admins who manages Windows PCs of other languages.
  
  .  No need to log off; settings are applied immediately.
  
  .  Comes with a restorer too. Apply or restore is as simple as a click.
  
  .  Better character compatibility than changing DOS codepage.
  
  .  Most languages and executables are supported. Customizable.
  
  .  Administrator rights are required. It asks for rights to elevates itself.
     Does not elevate over network mapped drives however.
  
  .  Windows Vista or above only (Windows Vista/7/8/8.1, Server 2008/2012[R2])

  .  Portable by default. Optional installer enables 'englishize' and 'restore'
     commands globally (in Command Prompt and Run prompt. For PowerShell, the
     commands would be 'englishize.bat' and 'restore.bat')

     [ Instructions ]
  
  1. "Englishize.bat" for changing command line tools from non-English to
      English.
      
  2. "Restore.bat" to restore everything back to original language.
      
  3. "_lang_codes.txt" is a modifiable list containing all non-English language
      codes. It includes most languages but in case your language is not there,
      add it and "Englishize Cmd" will support it.
      
  4. "_files_to_process.txt" is a modifiable list of file names of command-line
     executables that will be affected in the change. All commands in Windows
     Vista and 7 should be covered (although it contains much more commands
     than there actually are, it doesn't matter because it has no effect on
     commands that don't exist.)
     
     If you decide some commands are better left localized rather than being
     changed to English, remove them from the list before running "Englishize.
     bat".
     
     Also, although the list covers command-line executables, you can add GUI
     -- Graphical User Interface - programs such as Paint - mspaint.exe and
     lots of others to "_files_to_process.txt". There is a limitation here
     though. Windows comes with both English and non-English .mui files for
     command-line programs only; by default .mui for GUI programs don't exist
     in en-US folder until users install the English MUI through Windows
     Update) or Vistalizator (for non-Ultimate/Enterprise Windows users).
